# 🤖❓ Questions about using SqlServerLocalDB in Unit Tests

- I am working on a .NET 9.0 application
- I do not have access to docker
- I only have access to SQLServerLocalDB
- I would like to be able to write integration tests in `XUnit` and for each integration test, group of integration tests, or test suite be able to create new instances of my SqlServer database in SQLLocalDB
	- So I will need to be able to create the database from scratch using SQL Server T-SQL scripts, run the unit tests and tear the database down. 
- Can you give me some guidance around how I might do this
